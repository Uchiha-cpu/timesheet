# How to Use the Timesheet Tracker

This document provides instructions on how to use the Timesheet Tracker application.

## Getting Started

This project offers two ways to run the Timesheet Tracker application:

### 1. Single-File Application (timesheet_app.html)

This is a standalone HTML file that provides a monthly, editable, grid-based timesheet. It's simple to use and requires no setup.

**To run:**

1.  Locate the `timesheet_app.html` file in the project root.
2.  Open the file directly in your web browser (e.g., by double-clicking it).

This option is suitable if you need a quick and simple timesheet solution without any development environment setup.

### 2. Robust Angular Application (timesheet-angular)

This is a more feature-rich and extensible application built with Angular. It provides a robust foundation for adding more features and is recommended for development and customization.

**To run:**

1.  **Navigate to the Angular project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd timesheet-angular
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    (You only need to do this once, or if `package.json` changes.)
3.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will compile the application and open it in your default web browser, usually at `http://localhost:4200/`.

This option is ideal if you plan to extend the application, contribute to its development, or require a more scalable solution.

## Features of Single-File Application (timesheet_app.html)


### Monthly Summary View

The application now presents a single, Excel-like monthly grid. Each row represents an employee for the selected month.

### Adding a New Employee

1.  Enter the employee's name in the "Add New Employee" field. Names must be unique.
2.  Click the **Add Employee** button. The new employee will appear as a new row in the summary grid.
3.  **Enhanced Logic**: If an employee with the same name already exists (even if previously deleted or with a future start month), their `startMonth` will be updated to the current month, and they will be re-activated if necessary.

### Deleting an Employee

1.  Click the "üóëÔ∏è" icon next to the employee's name in the summary grid.
2.  Confirm the deletion. This will remove the employee and all their associated timesheet data.

### Editing Timesheet Entries

Directly in the monthly summary grid, click on any day's cell for an employee to select a status from the dropdown:
*   **H - Work from Home**
*   **O - Office**
*   **L - Full Leave**
*   **L1 - Leave First Half**
*   **L2 - Leave Second Half**

Changes are saved automatically.

### Filtering by Month

Use the "Filter by Month" input to select the month you want to view or edit. Employee names are automatically carried forward to the new month.
*   **Clear Filter**: Clearing the month input (e.g., by clicking the 'x' icon in some browsers) will reset the filter to the current month.

### Color-Coded WFH Summary

The "WFH Days" column shows the total number of Work from Home days for each employee in the selected month. The count is color-coded:
*   **Blue:** 1-8 WFH days
*   **Red:** More than 8 WFH days

### Work from Home (WFH) Alerts

An alert will be displayed at the top of the page if any employee exceeds the 8-day WFH limit for the selected month.

### Exporting to Excel

Click the **Export Excel** button to download the current month's timesheet as an Excel file.

### Importing from Excel

1.  Click the **Import Excel** button.
2.  Select an Excel file. The file should have "Employee Name", "Date", and "Status" columns.
3.  The data will be imported. New employees will be added, and their `startMonth` will be set to the earliest month found in the imported data, ensuring they only appear from that month onwards. Existing employees will have their `startMonth` updated if the imported data indicates an earlier start.

### Data Persistence

All data is saved in your browser's local storage, so it persists between sessions. It is recommended to export your data periodically as a backup.
